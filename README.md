# PhD: SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses in childhood: modelling approaches to understand and predict their epidemiological evolution

If you are here, you probably have scanned a QR code from one of my congress posters. Welcome!

You will find two files:
1. evolution_logistic_adjustment.gif: A gif showing the evolution of the model and its parameters iteratively adding data of bronchiolitis diagnoses. 
2. figure_error_pred.png: An image showing the number of days of difference between the predicted peak by the model and the real peak in bronchiolitis diagnoses that season. This figure has cumulative number of infected people at x axis and the delay in days in y axis. The horizontal red dashed lines show a 7-day up and low margin for the delay of the prediction, and the vertical dashed blue line represents the peak of infections.

In both, each step corresponds to 5 days.
